# Redux w/ Hooks - MovieDB

This is the excellent 2017 [redux tutorial on Levelup][redux-tutorial] by Scott Tolinski - but I've done this with [React Hooks][hooks] rather than using lifecycles and class components - resulting in cleaner/fewer lines of code.

Using a free [API key The Movie Database][moviedbapi]
